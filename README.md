# Overview

DeepSlate Tutor is your academic weapon. It’s a multi-modal study companion built entirely using vibe coding.

Why did we build this?<br> 
We're grad students. We know the pain of drowning in complex papers, endless lecture slides, and scattered notes. We’ve always wanted a single app that could help us understand difficult concepts and revise them. We couldn't find one that worked the way our brains do, so we vibe coded it ourselves.



# Features
### Multi-Modal Input

   - Documents: PDFs, PPTs.
   - Visuals: Images of diagrams, messy whiteboard photos.
   - Media: YouTube links (we parse the transcripts + visual context).
   - Voice Input: We capture your voice and feed it straight to Gemini for instant answers.

### Neuro-Inclusive Design

Built for every type of brain. We know one size doesn't fit all.<br>
Switch instantly to Dyslexia-friendly fonts or ADHD-focused layouts to keep you locked in without the sensory overload.

### Reasoning Graphs
Stop reading linear text. We generate dynamic Reasoning Graphs that visualize how Concept A connects to Concept B.

### Active Recall

   - Flashcards: Auto-generated spaced repetition cards.
   - Quizzes: Check your knowledge with AI-generated questions that test your understanding.

### Implementation Mode

If the content involves code or algorithms, the app automatically detects it and generates a clean Python implementation for you to run and tweak.

### Revision
Save key concepts to your personal library and review them later.

### Read Aloud
Let the app explain the reasoning graphs and analysis breakdown to you.
